description: Though best known for his heartwarming holiday tales and sweeping social
  novels such as A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations, Charles Dickens was
  a prolific writer who was always willing to experiment with new styles. The chilling
  tales collected in Three Ghost Stories are a result of his brief but successful
  foray into the mystery and detective genres.
